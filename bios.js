I listen to every genre, although I tend to listen to more hip-hop and alternative music than other genres.    I love art and film in general - always down to watch films, documentaries, and TV shows that are well-shot or on design! Really liking Netflix's recent Abstract: The Art of Design. My current favorite television shows at the moment are Westworld, Mr. Robot, Silicon Valley, and Billions.    I'm very interested in design, and in general, user experience - I'm always thinking about the difference details make. For example, the attention to detail in Stranger Things, from the typography to the opening credits to the interests of the characters were all really well done, and really added authenticity to the show.    I'm also very passionate about tech policy. I believe internet policy will be one of the defining legislation of the 21st century, and that consumer privacy and security should be at the forefront of innovation. It's a big reason why I'm very excited about the role of bitcoin in the future of tech! Great read: https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/industries-disrupted-blockchain/",

The first day I walked into my apartment last summer, the door was open and things were all over the place. No one was in the apartment but I saw a cage. My first thought was that I need to go down stairs and make sure there is a witness before any serial killer take me down.

My roommate said to me on the first week, \"did you realize that you said 'this is my first doing doing xxx' more than 10 times already this week?\" Yes, last summer was my first time moving out and living by myself, and everything was so fresh and new.

I want to get as much real world programming experience as possible to see how my skills may apply to the company and help people. I want to know everyone I work with in a personal level and build my relationship with them both as a colleague and as a friend. I also want to make sure I learn as much as possible at work and after work to ensure that I will have everything needed when the team needed my specialities.   Second, I was leading an intern team to develop an application that simplifies GE's IT Incident Process last summer. It was great to learn about leadership and do above and beyond. I would love to do the same thing with Capital One internship to start a side project on my own time and see how that may contribute to the company.   Last but not least, I will be having fun with other interns to get exposure of their lives and why they made the decisions they did to get to where they are now. I am all about consistent learning and improving myself to reach a better self. I believe meeting more people and understanding their paths will help me find out my own. ",
