# nessie_alexa
Alexa skill I made during Capital One Intern Hackathon.

It goes through C1's Nessie API to answer questions about the user's bank account (bank balance, upcoming bills, etc.).
It also has data about all the summer interns and answers questions about them (university, fun fact, etc.).
